YT SaneGrid
===========

[Related Discussion](http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!category-topic/youtube/uVzkGUO7FKE)

YouTube abandoned the subscription grid view. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move.

There are a number of issues with using the API to recreate the experience, so here is my attempt at hacking together something usable until either YT creates a substitute, or enough people help me out make my extremely poor code into something that recreates the full experience.

Caveats:

* Cannot hide what you've watched (it uses a cheap substitute, blanking the titles)
* API restricts loading to two sets of videos (94, I think). So press that search button twice to get the maximum number of videos
